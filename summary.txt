Spectre V1 is a flaw in modern processors that comes from the way they speed things up by guessing what will happen next. Sometimes these guesses briefly touch information they shouldn’t, and small traces of that information can be measured and reconstructed in a controlled experiment.

Our project explains how this happens and demonstrates it safely, showing how a performance feature can accidentally create a security risk. It highlights why improving processor design is important for keeping future systems secure.
